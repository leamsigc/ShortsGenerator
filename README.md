## Fonts 🅰

Add your fonts to the `static/assets/fonts` and change the font name in the global settings.


## Next Development FE:

Before running the front end create the following folders:

1. `static`
2. `static/generated_videos` -> All videos generated that have music will be here
3. `static/Songs` -> Put the mp4 songs that you want to use here

Start the front end:
1. `cd UI`
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run dev`

The alternative front end will be on port 3000

The frontend depends on the backend.
You can run the Docker container or you can run the backend locally
